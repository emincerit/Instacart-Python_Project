Instacart is a real online grocery store, which operates through website and an app. 
This project was handled by using Python as part of the Data Analytics Course at CareerFoundry.

## Introduction 

[Instacart](www.instacart.com), a tech company founded in 2012 that operates as a same-day-grocery-pick-up-and-delivery service in the U.S. and Canada.
The service allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers with the shopping being done by a personal shopper.
Facts: 500 million products, 40.000 stores, 5.500+ cities.


## Objectives

Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. This project is about performing an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better
segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
  the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
  customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
