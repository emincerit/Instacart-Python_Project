# Instacart-Python_Project

Instacart is an existing online grocery store in the U.S.A., which operates through an app. 
This project was handled by using Python as part of the Data Analytics Course at CareerFoundry.

## Introduction 


## Objectives

Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. This project is about performing an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better
segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
  the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
  customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
